Features
--------

Authlib Loginpass contains lots of connections (see below), every connection has a
`profile()` method which returns the same format of user info. It supports OAuth 1,
OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect for now.

The user info that `profile()` returns is standardized with [OpenID Connect UserInfo
claims](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims),
not something made by me.
